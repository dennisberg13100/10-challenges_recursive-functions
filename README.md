# 10 Challenges - Recursive Functions

Recursive functions are important in programming because they provide a powerful and versatile tool for solving certain types of problems in an elegant and efficient way. They allow complex problems to be broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, making them easier to understand and solve. Recursive functions can also make code more readable and memory-efficient in certain cases. They can be used to solve a wide range of problems, from simple mathematical calculations to complex data structures and algorithms. Additionally, understanding recursive functions is a fundamental problem-solving technique in computer science and programming, making it an essential skill for any developer.

- [x] **Fibonacci sequence:** Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.

- [ ] **Factorial:** Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns its factorial using recursion.

- [ ] **Binary search:** Write a function that takes an array of integers and a target value as input, and uses recursion to perform a binary search on the array for the target value. The function should return the index of the target value if it is found, or -1 if it is not found.

- [ ] **Tower of Hanoi:** Write a function that takes an integer n as input, and recursively solves the Tower of Hanoi problem for n discs. The function should print out the steps required to move all the discs from the first tower to the third tower.

- [ ] **Sum of digits:** Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the sum of its digits using recursion.

- [ ] **Palindrome:** Write a function that takes a string as input and uses recursion to determine whether it is a palindrome (i.e. reads the same forwards and backwards).

- [ ] **Merge sort:** Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and uses recursion to implement the merge sort algorithm.

- [ ] **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor):** Write a function that takes two integers as input and uses recursion to compute their greatest common divisor.

- [ ] **Binary tree traversal:** Write a function that takes a binary tree as input and uses recursion to perform a depth-first traversal of the tree.

- [ ] **Permutations:** Write a function that takes a string as input and uses recursion to generate all possible permutations of its characters.
